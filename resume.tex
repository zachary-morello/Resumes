          \begin{itemize}%
              \item Developed major features of a forecasting web application using C\# in ASP.NET that served over 100 managers within the company. Specific contributions:
                \begin{itemize}%
                    \item Designed and implemented a web page for data importing that communicated to the user percentage progress and success/error states using Javascript, HTML and CSS.
                    \item Achieved a 500\% speed improvement in data exports by refactoring SQL queries and implementing multi-threading. Created an inheritable class for future export development.
                    \item Implemented fail-safes that prevent service crashes on low performance hardware, ensuring they wait for sufficient memory before execution.      
                    \item Awarded a recognition certificate from section manager for delivering innovative solutions and saving the organization thousands of hours of time with the new forecasting tools.
                \end{itemize} 
            \end{itemize}
            \begin{itemize}%
            \item Headed development of a change management Blazor app and created an interactive Figma prototype to facilitate user feedback sessions.
                \begin{itemize}%
                    \item Worked with subject matter experts on reverse engineering the original application. From that work, created a requirements document that has been leveraged on other projects.
                    \item Adapted prototype into a user interface with Blazor Webassembly and C\#.
                \end{itemize} 
            \item Implemented a variety of bugfixes in C\# and Javascript across the organization's suite of applications, many within hours of user reports.
            \item Contributed to daily stand-up meetings to coordinate with team members, provide progress updates, and plan daily objectives.
            \item Led discussions about software engineering standards, leveraging new technologies for our projects and wrote documentation to ensure sustainable code practices within the team.
